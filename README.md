# Marketing Campaign Classification using Machine Learning  

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on classifying data from a **Marketing Campaign** dataset. The project utilizes the **Random Forest** algorithm to predict outcomes and analyze campaign effectiveness.  

## Features  
- **Dataset**: Uses the **Marketing Campaign** dataset for training and evaluation.  
- **Random Forest Model**: Employs a robust and accurate classification model.  
- **Data Processing**: Includes data cleaning, feature selection, and preprocessing steps.  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Measures model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  

## How to Use  
1. Clone this repository and ensure Python or MATLAB (or any other specified tool) is installed.  
2. Install necessary dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if applicable).  
3. Load the Marketing Campaign dataset.  
4. Run the script to preprocess data, train the model, and evaluate performance.  
5. View classification results and analysis in the output.  

## Tools & Libraries  
- **Random Forest**: For classification tasks.  
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes handling missing values, scaling, and feature engineering.  
- **Evaluation Framework**: Provides detailed insights into model accuracy and prediction quality.  

## Objectives  
- Understand customer behavior through classification.  
- Build a machine learning pipeline for predictive analysis.  
- Demonstrate the effectiveness of the Random Forest algorithm in marketing applications.  

This project is ideal for those interested in machine learning, predictive analytics, and marketing data analysis.
